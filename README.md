# OOPCookbook
A repository for the Object Oriented Programming class's final project

The CookBook application is a simplified Java-terminal based program that allows users to store, browse, and manage their favorite recipes. It supports the functionalities of adding new recipes, searching recipes by name or description, favoriting, editing, or deleting recipes.
